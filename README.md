# Nature Tracker

[My Notes](notes.md)

The Nature Tracker is a creative and innovative application that is used to encourage people to spend more time in nature. It allows users to log outdoor activities and keeps track of their streak for how many days in a row they spent outside.

> This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [ ] Proper use of Markdown

### Elevator pitch

Have you ever felt the call of the wild? Have you ever felt like something was missing within yourself? We all have! Due to our fast paced and work oriented society, we often miss out on opportunities to stop and literally smell the roses. This application, the **Nature Tracker**, encourages users to spend more time outside and enjoy the wonderous world in which we live. Its simple design allows the user to track time spent outside and even compete with others to see who can spend the most consecutive days enjoy the beauties of mother nature. Spending more time outside can literally change your life, as mentioned in [this article](https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/time-spent-in-nature-can-boost-physical-and-mental-well-being/).

- Score algorithm that gives more points based off of a variety of factors
    - length of streak
    - weather at time of the recording of the entry

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Three HTML pages, as shown in the description above. 
  - Login page
  - Entry creation page
  - Leaderboard page
- **CSS** - Application styling that reflects the purpose of the application. This will include nature-like colors such as
  - Green
  - Sky Blue
  - Brown
  - Grey
- **React** - React will be in display of all the UI logic like controlling login, displaying the entry input, displaying the point scoring, and the displaying rankings
- **Service** - Backend functionality for logic and processing
  - API calls to weather (for pointage)
  - pointage calculation
  - user authentication
- **DB/Login** - Stores user information, such as
  - user login information
  - user entry streak
  - user pointage/ranking
- **WebSocket** - As users input entries and the user scores are updated, the websocket will update the ranking of the leaderboard, as well as update the information that the other users can see of each other (streak sharing)
